\section{Introduction}

Something about tracking.

\section{Constrained Network Flow Reformulation of Consveration Tracking}

\subsection{Conservation Tracking Model}
We formualte tracking by assignment as a graphical model with detecetion nodes and stuff.

This graphical model will be reformulated into a network flow and solved as an ILP.

\subsection{ILP for Network Flow}
To solve ILPs we do LP relaxation.

Our Network flow ILP looks like this:

A LOT OF MATH

\subsection{Loosening Constraints}

On this we do cutting constraints! Because TUM something.

What we do is cut all constraints and try to solve. If it's solved, great, if not, we add constraints to nodes with flow violation. Then solve again. Repeat until we find valid solution or no new violated nodes.

\section{Experiments and Results}

Our models are: Drosophila and Rapoport (with and without mergers?)

\subsection{Solutions}

\subsection{Computation Time}


\section{Conclusion}

It works but isn't really worth it.
